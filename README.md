S1-S2_interface_test

Build the pTTs, pack the S1-S2 links with pTTS and TCs, unpack pTTs and build energy map, create EMP file to test S2 boards.

- ECONT : create trigger sum (= module sums) --> two possible scenarios
- S1 simulation : create the pTTs with the module sums energies
- link packing : pack TCs and pTTs in the links
- link unpacking : unpack pTTs and plot Trigger Towers
